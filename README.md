In this project, the major factor responsible for patients not showing up (NoShow) for their medical appointment will be analyzed. This dataset contains information from 110,526 patients in Brazil.

The dataset provides dependent and independent variables. At least one dependent and three independent variable will be analyzed.Some of the independent variables to be analyzed include Age, Gender and SMS received, while showup will be the dependent variable to beam the searchlight on.

Over 22,000 patients did not show up for their appointment, this constitutes about 20% of the all the patientâ€™s data acquired for analysis. About 20% of both male and female did not showup for their appointment. This reveals that gender is not a factor that affects patients appointments.
This is a major factor that affect patients showing up as reveal by the ananlysis. A large proportion of patients within the age group categorized as infants, old and very old keep up with their appointments.
